  # Hello, hola!

  My name is Ecesu Ürker, and I am a Research Assistant at the [Computational Linguistics and Theoretical Linguistics Lab (COLT)](https://www.upf.edu/web/colt), [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu). My research focuses on language change and evolution, which I study through deep learning and computational modeling.

## Hello World!

  I hold a Summa Cum Laude Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Bilkent University, where I developed a strong interest in the connection between mind and language. To explore this, I gained hands-on experience in Psycholinguistics labs, actively contributing to projects from experimental design to data collection and analysis. Alongside my studies, I took courses in Python programming and Linear Algebra, which provided me with a strong computational foundation.
  Driven by my passion for language and cognition, I pursued a Master’s in Cognitive Science at the University of Trento, specializing in Computational and Theoretical Modelling of Language and Cognition. During this time, I deepened my knowledge of Theoretical and Computational Linguistics and conducted research at [Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK)](https://www.fbk.eu/en/). My projects focused on iconicity in deep learning models and homonym perception in LLMs, culminating in a thesis completed with the 110/110 GPA.
  Since February 2025, I have been working as a Research Assistant at the [Computational Linguistics and Theoretical Linguistics Lab (COLT)](https://www.upf.edu/web/colt) at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu), under the supervision of [Gemma Boleda](https://gboleda.github.io). My current research focuses on modeling semantic change, bridging insights from linguistics and AI.
  My broader research interests include language change and evolution through deep learning techniques, as well as the intersection of Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Natural Language Processing.
  And a little fun fact about me: I appeared on the Turkish version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' — I made it all the way to the 12th question before deciding to withdraw! If you’re curious, you can watch my episode [here](https://youtu.be/RwBxjAr5T2U?si=7lfFELyp7I2UEw2J).
