  # Hello, hola!

  My name is Ecesu Ürker and I am a Research Assistant at the Computational Linguistics and Theoretical Linguistics Lab (COLT) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. My research interests are language change and evolution and modelling them using deep learning techniques.

## Hello World!

  I hold a Summa Cum Laude degree in Psychology from Bilkent University, where I developed a strong interest in the connection between mind and language. To explore this, I gained hands-on experience in Psycholinguistics labs, actively contributing to research projects from experimental design to data collection and analysis. Alongside my studies, I took courses in Python programming and Linear Algebra, equipping me with a computational perspective.

  Driven by my passion for language and cognition, I pursued a Master’s in Cognitive Science at the University of Trento, specializing in Computational and Theoretical Modelling of Language and Cognition. During this time, I deepened my knowledge of Theoretical and Computational Linguistics and conducted research at Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK). My work focused on iconicity in deep learning models and homonym perception in LLMs, culminating in a thesis that earned me a 110/110 GPA.

  As of February 2025, I am a Research Assistant at the Computational Linguistics and Theoretical Linguistics Lab (COLT) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, working under Gemma Boleda. My research focuses on modelling semantic change, bridging linguistics and AI.

  I am particularly interested in investigating language change and evolution using deep learning techniques, the intersection of Cognitive Science and Linguistics with Natural Language Processing.
